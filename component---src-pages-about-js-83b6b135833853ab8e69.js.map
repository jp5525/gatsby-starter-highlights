Everything and anything could easily upset me, and I began to adapt the belief that my emotions were unhelpful and too scary to face so I attempted to shut down this emotional aspect of the Self and in doing so went down a road of hurt, pain, and loneliness. In my attempt to “turn off” the emotional Self, I discovered that all I was doing was abandoning myself, and soon I began a journey of self-healing, self-discovery, and self-cultivating.\n          </p>\n          <p style={{textAlign:\"left\"}}>\n          I found healing in feeling - in accepting the feelings about who I am, the feelings about where I am, and the feelings I have about my feelings.

Sometimes the healing journey (a life-long journey) can be challenging to endure, and I do not believe we have to endure it alone. We all encounter suffering, pain, and loss. As a fellow traveler on this healing journey, I would be honored to be a person who holds this space for you as you unravel the many complexities of what it is like to be you.</p>\n        </div>\n        <Scroll type=\"id\" element=\"two\">\n          <a href=\"#two\" className=\"goto-next \">\n            Next\n          </a>\n        </Scroll>\n      </div>\n\n      \n        </section>\n\n\n      <section id=\"two\" className=\"main special\">\n      <div style={{marginBottom:\"35px\"}} className=\"container\">\n        <span className=\"image fit primary\">\n          <img src={sections[1].bg} alt=\"\" />\n        </span>\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <header className=\"major\">\n            <h2>Naming Sacred Garden</h2>\n          </header>\n          <p style={{textAlign:\"left\"}}>\n          One day during a meditation, I saw myself walking through an open, white space. I came to a door, and with no prompting, I instinctively knew this was a doorway to my heart. Not the physical, blood-pumping sense of the word heart, but the access to the love that exists within the physical body. I opened the door to discover a vast, limitless garden - surrounded by luscious greenery and an abundance of flowers. I was instantly reminded that I am sacred. I was reminded how to love from the inside out, and to always be cultivating my sense of self.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n          <i>Sacred Garden, LLC was founded by Samantha Piro in loving memory of her grandmother, Mary DeCaussin, who shared her love through gardening and cultivating all things beautiful.</i>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div className=\"row\">\n                \n                <div className=\"col-6 col-12-medium\">\n                  <a href=\"/#two\" className=\"button primary\" style={{paddingLeft:\"3em\", paddingRight:\"3em\"}}>Services</a>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n                <div className=\"col-6 col-12-medium\">\n                  \n                   <Link to=\"/#footer\" className=\"button primary\">Contact Me</Link> \n                  \n                </div>\n                \n              </div>\n          \n        \n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n      </section>\n        <Scrollspy\n        items={sections.map(s => s.id)}\n        currentClassName=\"active\"\n        offset={-250}\n        componentTag={'div'}\n        >\n        {sections.map(s => {\n            return (\n            <div\n                key={s.id}\n                className=\"main-bg\"\n                id={`${s.id}-bg`}\n                style={{ backgroundImage: `url(${overLayPic}), url(${s.bg})` }}\n            />\n            );\n        })}\n    </Scrollspy>\n        \n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
